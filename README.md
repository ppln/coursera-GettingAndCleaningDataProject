#Files
* "run_analysis.R" was created by RStudio(Version 0.99.491) based on R-3.2.3. It will download the data set, unzip the file, read the data sets, and do some merging, cleaning, and finally output an independent tidy data set.

* "CodeBook.md" describes all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

* "tidy.txt" is the tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
